    No scan results?

        Ensure ClamAV is installed and virus definitions are up to date.

        Check if PowerShell has permission to write to your Desktop.

        Review console for errors.

    Slow scans?

        Avoid clamscan.exe; prefer clamdscan.exe.

        Avoid scanning entire C:\ drive unless necessary.
